    summary: `BoardBatch is my "IndieHacker" side-project, created out of a need from people around me, it aims to bring niche jobs to the surface. Usually buried under the noise of promoted, corporate, "ghost" or simply fake job listings, BoardBatch gathers, filters and processes jobs directly from companies job pages and brings those to the forefront. Initially targeting the niche of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), I discovered I could apply the same techniques to create a more generic solution that targets any niche with ease. From there I have launched several job boards as my testing grounds, which receive about 500-1000 unique monthly visitors and curently serve a combined total of about 80.000 live job listings at any given time. To prototype and iterate quickly, I've used SvelteKit, Supabase (PostgreSQL) and Cloudflare Workers, and run several scraping Node.js scripts on a simple Hetzner VPS. `,
